# Pathfinding Lab (C++)

This project implements a tile-based pathfinding algorithm using Uniform-Cost Search (UCS). It was developed as part of a school lab assignment using C++ and Visual Studio.

## Files Included

- `PathSearch.cpp` — core pathfinding logic
- `PathSearch.h` — class declarations
- `.sln` file — Visual Studio project 
- `Platform.h` — platform abstraction or utility functions  
- `PriorityQueue.h` — custom priority queue implementation used by the algorithm  


## How to Run

1. Open the `.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Build the project.
3. Run and test the pathfinding logic between tiles.

## Note

Only key source files are included. Build folders and debug files are excluded.
